## Notice
The latest version (3.0.0) now also supports basic image loading/dumping. These are not automatically translated and the feature is disabled by default.

If you are going to make use of this feature, please make sure you read and understand the [Texture Translation](#texture-translation) section!

## Text Frameworks
This is an auto translation mod that hooks into the unity game engine and attempts to provide translations for the following text frameworks for Unity:
 * UGUI
 * NGUI
 * IMGUI
 * TextMeshPro
 * Utage (VN Game Engine)

It does go to the internet, in order to provide the translation, so if you are not comfortable with that, dont use it.
 
## Plugin Frameworks
The mod can be installed into the following Plugin Managers:
 * [BepInEx](https://github.com/bbepis/BepInEx)
 * [IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA)
 * UnityInjector

Installations instructions for both methods can be found below.

Additionally it can be installed without a dependency on a plugin manager through ReiPatcher. However, this approach is not recommended if you use one of the above mentioned Plugin Managers!

## Key Mapping
The following key inputs are mapped:
 * ALT + T: Alternate between translated and untranslated versions of all texts provided by this plugin.
 * ALT + D: Dump untranslated texts (if no endpoint is configured)
 * ALT + R: Reload translation files. Useful if you change the text and texture files on the fly. Not guaranteed to work for all textures.
 * ALT + U: Manual hooking. The default hooks wont always pick up texts. This will attempt to make lookups manually.
 * ALT + F: If OverrideFont is configured, will toggle between overridden and default font.

## Installation

## Translating Mods
Often other mods UI are implemented through IMGUI. As you can see above, this is disabled by default. By changing the "EnableIMGUI" value to "True", it will start translating IMGUI as well, which likely means that other mods UI will be translated.

## Texture Translation
From version 3.0.0+ this mod provides basic capabilities to replace images. It is a feature that is disabled by default. There is no automatic translation of these images though.

It is controlled by the following configuration:

```ini
[Texture]
TextureDirectory=Translation\Texture
EnableTextureTranslation=False
EnableTextureDumping=False
EnableTextureToggling=False
EnableTextureScanOnSceneLoad=True
LoadUnmodifiedTextures=False
TextureHashGenerationStrategy=FromImageName
```

`TextureDirectory` specifies the directory where textures are dumped to and loaded from. Loading will happen from all subdirectories of the specified directory as well, so you can move dumped images to whatever folder structure you desire.

`EnableTextureTranslation` enables texture translation. This basically means that textures will be loaded from the `TextureDirectory` and it's subsdirectories. These images will replace the in-game images used by the game.

`EnableTextureDumping` enables texture dumping. This means that the mod will dump any images it has not already dumped to the `TextureDirectory`. **NEVER REDISTRIBUTE THIS MOD WITH THIS ENABLED.**

`EnableTextureScanOnSceneLoad` allows the plugin to scan for texture objects on the sceneLoad event. This enables the plugin to find more texture at a tiny performance cost. However, because of the way Unity works not all of these are guaranteed to be replacable. If you find an image that is dumped but cannot be translated, please report it. However, please recognize this mod is primarily intended for replacing UI textures, not textures for 3D meshes.

`LoadUnmodifiedTextures` enables whether or not the plugin should load textures that has not been modified. This is only useful for debugging, and likely to cause various visual glitches, especially if `EnableTextureScanOnSceneLoad` is also enabled. **NEVER REDISTRIBUTE THIS MOD WITH THIS ENABLED.**

`EnableTextureToggling` enables whether the ALT+T hotkey will also toggle textures. Also this by no means guaranteed to work, especially if `EnableTextureScanOnSceneLoad` is also enabled. **NEVER REDISTRIBUTE THIS MOD WITH THIS ENABLED.**

`TextureHashGenerationStrategy` specifies how images are identified. When images are stored, the game will need some way of associating them with the image that it has to replace.
This is done through a hash-value that is stored in square brackets in each image file name, like this: `file_name [0223B639-6E698E92].png`. This configuration specifies how these hash-values are generated:
 * `FromImageName` means that the hash is generated from the internal resource name that the game uses for the image, which may not exist for all images or even be unique. However, it is generally fairly reliable.
 * `FromImageData` means that the hash is generated from the data stored in the image, which is guaranteed to exist for all images. However, generating the hash comes at a performance cost.
 * `FromImageNameThenData` means that it should use the name, if available, otherwise use the data.

There's an important catch you need to be aware when dealing with these options and that is if ANY of these options exists: `EnableTextureDumping=True`, `EnableTextureToggling=True`, `TextureHashGenerationStrategy=FromImageData|FromImageNameThenData`, then the game will need to read the raw data from all images it finds in game in order to replace the image and this is an expensive operation.

It is therefore recommended to use `TextureHashGenerationStrategy=FromImageName`. Most likely, images without a resource name won't be interesting to translate anyway.

If you redistribute this mod with translated images, it is recommended you delete all images you either have no intention of translating or are not translated at all.

You can also change the file name to whatever you desire, as long as you keep the hash appended to the end of the file name.

If you take anything away from this section, it should be these two points:
 * **NEVER REDISTRIBUTE THIS MOD WITH `EnableTextureDumping=True`, `EnableTextureToggling=True` OR `LoadUnmodifiedTextures=True`**
 * **ONLY DISTRIBUTE THIS MOD WITH `TextureHashGenerationStrategy=FromImageData|FromImageNameThenData` ENABLED IF ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED BY THE GAME.**

### Technical details about Hash Generation in file names
There are actually two hashes in the generated file name, separated by a dash (-):
 * The first hash is a SHA1 (only first 4 bytes) based on the `TextureHashGenerationStrategy` used. If `FromImageName` is specified, then it is based on the UTF8 representation.
 * The second hash is a SHA1 (only first 4 bytes) based on the data in the image. This is used to determine whether or not the image has been modified, so images that has not been edited are not loaded. Unless `LoadUnmodifiedTextures` is specified.

If `TextureHashGenerationStrategy=FromImageData` is specified, only a single hash will appear in each file name, as that single hash can be used both to identify the image and to determine whether or not it has been edited.

## Integrating with Auto Translator

### Implementing a dedicated translation component
As a mod author implementing a translation plugin, you are able to, if you cannot find a translation to a string, simply delegate it to this mod, and you can do it without taking any references to this plugin.

Here's how it works, and what is required:
 * You must implement a Component (MonoBehaviour for instance) that this plugin is able to locate by simply traversing all objects during startup.
 * On this component you must add an event for the text hooks you want to override from XUnity AutoTranslator. This is done on a per text framework basis. The signature of these events must be: Func<object, string, string>. The arguments are, in order: 
    1. The component that represents the text in the UI. (The one that probably has a property called 'text').
    2. The untranslated text
    3. This is the return value and will be the translated text IF an immediate translation took place. Otherwise it will simply be null.
 * The signature for each framework looks like:
    1. UGUI: public static event Func<object, string, string> OnUnableToTranslateUGUI
    2. TextMeshPro: public static event Func<object, string, string> OnUnableToTranslateTextMeshPro
    3. NGUI: public static event Func<object, string, string> OnUnableToTranslateNGUI
    3. IMGUI: public static event Func<object, string, string> OnUnableToTranslateIMGUI
 * Also, the events can be either instance based or static.

### Implementing a component that the Auto Translator should not interfere with
As a mod author, you might not want the Auto Translator to interfere with your mods UI. If this is the case there's two ways to tell Auto Translator not to perform any translation:
 * If your UI is based on GameObjects, you can simply name your GameObjects containing the text element (for example Text class) to something that contains the string "XUAIGNORE". The Auto Translator will check for this and ignore components that contains the string.
 * If your UI is based on IMGUI, the above approach is not possible, because there are no GameObject. In that case you can do the following instead:

```C#
public class MyPlugin : XPluginBase
{
   private GameObject _xua;
   private bool _lookedForXua;

   public void OnGUI()
   {
      // make sure we only do this lookup once, as it otherwise may be detrimental to performance!
      // also: do not attempt to do this in the Awake method or similar of your plugin, as your plugin may be instantiated before the auto translator!
      if(!_lookedForXua)
      {
         _lookedForXua = true;
         _xua = GameObject.Find( "___XUnityAutoTranslator" );
      }

      // try-finally block is important to make sure you re-enable the plugin
      try
      {
         _xua?.SendMessage("DisableAutoTranslator");

         // do your GUI things here
         GUILayout.Button( "こんにちは！" );
      }
      finally
      {
         _xua?.SendMessage("EnableAutoTranslator");
      }
   }
}
```

This approach requires version 2.15.0 or later!
